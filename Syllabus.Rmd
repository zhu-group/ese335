**Credit:**   
The course has a credit of 3.0, with a total class hour of 48

**Overview:**   
As an interdisciplinary, environmental science gains insights from various data sets of field studies, lab experiments, remote sensing, and model simulations. Analyzing and visualizing data sets has become one of the most critical skills for carrying out environmental science studies. However, senior ESE undergraduate students often find their opportunities to access such courses confined, and specific training toward developing desired skills limited. 

This course will teach students how to apply suitable statistical methods and visualization tools to analyze environmental data sets. Topics include basics of statistics, features of environmental data sets, checking data sets, comparisons between two groups, comparisons among several groups, correlation, simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression. Students will also learn how to conduct data analysis properly with the R language.

This course facilitates student learning through the pre-class reading, examples, lectures, in-class exercises, assignments, midterm exam, final project, and one-on-one interactions. Students should be able to analyze and visualize environmental data sets using suitable statistical methods and R tools. This course would also boost studentsâ€™ programming skills, broadly applicable in their later study and research.

**Structure:**   
Students are **required** to finish the assigned reading before the class. For each section, new material will be demonstrated by the instructor, followed by in-class exercises. Students are also welcome to Office Hours held by the instructor and TAs for specific questions.
