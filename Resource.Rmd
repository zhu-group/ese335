# RStudio Desktop

We will use [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) to learn [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming.  

**Make sure you install R first before installing RStudio Desktop.**

* Install [R (v4.3.2)](https://cran.rstudio.com/) 
* Install [RStudio Desktop (2023.12.1+402)](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

# Websites

* [Seeing theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu)
* [Statistical visualizations](https://rpsychologist.com/viz/)

# Git
* Client: We use [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client) as the Git client. There are also many other third-party GUI tools, such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), etc.  

* Platform: We use [GitHub](https://github.com) as the repository version control platform. Follow [this page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration) for Github account setup and configuration. Other software/platform, like [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com) or [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org), will not be covered in the class.
