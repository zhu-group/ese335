Suppose we want to test whether a new technology is useful in removing pollutant X. To do so, we prepare `6` cases, randomly select `3` cases and apply the technology, leaving the rest without treatment. Then we measure X levels from the two groups (assuming no unit).

+ Group A (new technology applied): `1.0`, `2.0`, `3.0`

+ Group B (no treatment): `2.0`, `3.0`, `4.0`

So the mean of group A is `2.0`, mean of group B is `3.0`, with an observed difference of `-1.0`. One may argue the difference is caused by the new technology; while it is also possible that the difference could be driven by randomization when no treatment being applied. 

So the question is: can the observations back up the usefulness of the new technology?

# A randomization test example

Recall the processes of [hypothesis testing](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese335/S03.html#Hypothesis_tests) in Section 03.

Given the research question in the previous example, we write hypotheses as:

+ H~0~: The new technology can NOT remove X

+ H~1~: The new technology does have effects in removing X

Let's assume H~0~ is true, what is the chance of randomization leads to the observed or more extreme difference? In other words, what is the chance of grouping leads to the **observed or more extreme difference** given H~0~ is true? This can be written as:

$$P(diff <= -1.0 | H_{0} )$$
Since the sample size is small, we can write all possible groupings (combinations) for A with R.

```{r}
# Need `gtools` package
library(gtools)

# Obs from group A
Obs_A   <- c(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)

# Obs from group B
Obs_B   <- c(2.0, 3.0, 4.0)

# Compute the difference, d
Obs_difference <- mean(Obs_A) - mean(Obs_B)
print(Obs_difference)

# Given H0 is true, we assume that A and B are from the same population
# So the total possible groupings for A is C(6,3) 
Obs_all     <- c(Obs_A, Obs_B)
Groupings_A <- combinations(length(Obs_all), length(Obs_A), Obs_all, F)

# Show all possible groupings of A
print(Groupings_A)
```

Next, we can compute all possible differences:

```{r}
# Make an empty list
difference <- c()

# Loop all possible grouping methods for A
for(i in 1:dim(Groupings_A)[1]){
  
  # Mean of group A
  mean_A <- mean(Groupings_A[i,])
  
  # Mean of group B
  mean_B <- (sum(Obs_all)-sum(Groupings_A[i,]))/length(Obs_B)
  
  # Store difference
  difference <- c(difference, mean_A - mean_B)
}

# Show all possible differences
print(difference)

# Plot all possible differences
hist(difference)

# Add a vertical line
abline(v=Obs_difference, col="red", lwd=5, lty=2)
```

OK, given H~0~ is true, what is the chance that grouping leads to the observed or more extreme difference? From the above plot, we count that there are `5` cases out of `20` cases that the difference is as extreme or more extreme than `-1.0`. 

```{r}

# Compute p-value
length( which(difference <= Obs_difference) )/length(difference)
```

The p-value, in this case, is `0.25`, which is not a small value (compared with `0.05`). So we can not rule out that H~0~, meaning the observations fail to back up the usefulness of the new technology.

Now change the observations to:

+ Group A (new technology applied): `1.0`, `2.0`, `3.0`

+ Group B (no treatment): `20.0`, `30.0`, `40.0`

Re-compute the p-value, see what would change. Can you explain why?

# Probability Density Function (PDF)

In probability theory, a probability density function (PDF) $f(x)$, or density of a **continuous random variable**, is a function that describes the relative likelihood (probability or chance) for this random variable $X$ to take on a given value $x$.

Probability density function is defined by following formula:
$$ P(a \le X \le b) = \int_a^b f(x) ~ dx $$

## Exercise #1

Suppose we want to test another new technology, to check whether it is useful in **increasing** student's scores. To do so, we recruit `9` students, randomly select `5` of them to apply this technology, leaving the rest students without treatment. Then we measure scores from the two groups:

+ Group A (new technology applied): `2.0`, `3.0`, `4.0`, `5.0`, `6.0`

+ Group B (no treatment): `1.0`, `2.0`, `3.0`, `4.0`

Do the observations back up the usefulness of such new technology? Please use a significant level of `0.10`.

## Exercise #2

Suppose we want to test another new technology, to check whether it **has impact** on (could increase or reduce) student's scores. To do so, we recruit `9` students, randomly select `5` of them to apply this technology, leaving the rest students without treatment. Then we measure scores from the two groups:

+ Group A (new technology applied): `2.0`, `3.0`, `4.0`, `5.0`, `6.0`

+ Group B (no treatment): `1.0`, `2.0`, `3.0`, `4.0`

What is the p-value now? Why is it different from the p-value from the previous exercise #1?
