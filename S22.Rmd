# R Markdown

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. An R Markdown document is written in markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format) and contains chunks of embedded code. R Markdown files are designed to be used with the `rmarkdown` package. `rmarkdown` comes installed with the RStudio IDE.

R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to both

+ save and execute code,  

+ generate high-quality reports that can be shared with an audience.

R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of static and dynamic output formats. In this section, we will learn how to convert an R Markdown file into `html` files.

# Building a website

## Creating a repository on Github

+ Open GitKraken, make a new repository `web_test` by clicking `Start a hosted repo`, then fill the information, and save this repository locally (e.g., `C://web_test/`).

+ Download [this demo](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese335/download/web_demo.zip), decompress it, and copy all items (including files and folders) to the local repository folder `web_test`.

+ Stage and commit all changes, and push the local repository to Github.

## Home page

Each website requires a `.Rmd` file named `index.Rmd`, which provides the content for the home page of your website. Take the demo as an example, the `index.Rmd` provides a basic description of the website.  

```{bash, eval=F}
---
title: "My Website"
output:
  html_document:
    df_print: paged
---

Welcome to my website!  
I am a student at SUSTech, my research area is about xxx.
```

Here lines 1-6 mean that the output file will be in `html` format. And lines 8-9 can be replaced by real information.

## Global YAML header

Another necessary file is `_site.yml`, which provides the global YAML header for the whole site. In the demo, the `_site.yml` is written as:

```{bash, eval=F}
name: "My Website"
output_dir: "docs"  # docs directory of master branch
navbar:
  title: "xxx's website"
  type: inverse
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "Page1"
      href: Page1.html
    - text: "Page2"
      href: Page2.html
    - text: "Page3"
      href: Page3.html      
    - text: "Page4"
      menu:
        - text: "Page4.1"
          href: Page4.1.html
        - text: "Page4.2"
          href: Page4.2.html
        - text: "Page4.3"
          href: Page4.3.html   
output:
  html_document:
    theme: cerulean
    highlight: pygments
    
```

Here we define a home page with `index.Rmd`. `Page1` to `Page2` are static pages, and `Page4` has a drop-down menu. 

`theme` specifies the [Bootstrap](https://bootswatch.com/3/) theme to use for the page (themes are drawn from the Bootswatch theme library). Valid themes include:  

+ default
+ cerulean
+ journal
+ flatly
+ readable
+ spacelab
+ united
+ cosmo
+ lumen
+ paper
+ sandstone
+ simplex
+ yeti

You can check the above themes at this [gallery](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/). Pass null for no theme (in this case, you can use the `css` parameter to add your own styles). 

`highlight` specifies the syntax highlighting style. Supported styles include:  

+ default
+ tango
+ pygments
+ kate
+ monochrome
+ espresso
+ zenburn
+ haddock
+ breezedark
+ textmate  

Pass null to prevent syntax highlighting.

More about `_site.yml` can be found [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html#appearance_and_style).

## Markdown Syntax

See `Page1.Rmd` for basic syntax in R Markdown. More are available at this [R Markdown cheat sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf).  

## Build a site

You can check the current page by clicking `Knit`, a new window will pop up to show the `html` file.

Finally, when everything looks fine, set the `working directory` to the local repository (in this case, `C://web_test/`). In R console, run:

```{bash, eval=F}
rmarkdown::render_site()
```

In the demo, a website (and all `html` files) will be created in `docs/`. New your website is ready to be launched.

***

# Publish the website on Github

Go to Github:

+ Open the remote `web_test` repository on Github 
+ Click `Settings`  
+ Under `GitHub Pages` section, use `main` branch and `/docs` folder, then click `save`. You may receive an error email from Github, this is because remote repository is not updated yet. Ignore this error for now.

Open GitKraken, stage and commit all changes. And wait for a few minutes as Github is publishing the website. 

You should be able to view your website at: `https://xxx.github.io/web_test/`, where `xxx` is your Github user name.

*** 

# General workflow of updating the website

+ **Step 1:** Make changes to the source files (`.Rmd`)

+ **Step 2:** Check and verify with `knit`

+ **Step 3:** Re-build the website with `rmarkdown::render_site()`

+ **Step 4:** Stage and commit changes with GitKraken

+ **Step 5:** Push with GitKraken, and wait for a few minutes for updates take place. If you get an error message email from Github, go back to Step 1-4, fix the bug(s), and push again.
